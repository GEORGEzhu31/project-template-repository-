##How to Win the Championship in Formula-E?

- The driver with the most points is the `driver's champion`.

#Evaluation
- the `inherent uncertainty` in sports competitions is strong.

- the resultant `sample size` after data filtering may be `limited`, potentially compromising the generalizability and fairness of the results. 

- The 0.53 r.square implies a discernible correlation between a driver's participation frequency and their average performance, signifying a relationship between  `participation frequency and skill level.` 

- The linear regression can show the relationship between independent variable and dependent variable  `straightforwardly`.
