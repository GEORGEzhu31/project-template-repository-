## Research Question
The Formula E Championship, notorious for its unpredictability, is influenced by a myriad of factors such as driver expertise, car performance, circuit characteristics, and race formats, all contributing to its unforeseeable outcomes. This report aims to explore the relationship between XXX and XXX in the most impartial manner possible.

The report commences with a concise delineation of the methodology for curating pristine data, coupled with an exposition of the selected statistical models and the pertinent questions they are designed to address. Subsequently, tables, figures, summary values, and fitted models are presented in a clear and explanatory manner. The research then objectively highlights systematic and random errors found in the data, methodology, and practical implications, with proposed ethical solutions for systematic biases. Finally, the report addresses the research objectives and questions, offering responses based on the statistical analysis.



## Methods
1.the defination of the terminologies in the data set

"The initial step involved labeling the data as FERR0 and FERR. FERR0 retained four variables from the original dataset: 'season' (the nth racing season), 'race_num' (the mth race), 'driver' (the name of the driver), and 'points' (the total points for the mth race). FERR, on the other hand, was derived from FERR0 by filtering out all rows where the 'points' were zero."


## Data
1 list

"According to Fiaformulae, the champion of the Formula E Championship is determined by the driver with the highest cumulative points in the season. The following chart lists the drivers with the highest total points across seven seasons, comparing this data with the champion information provided by Formulaechronicles."
```{r, echo=FALSE}
best_drivers_summary <- FERR %>%
  group_by(season, driver) %>%
  summarise(total_points = sum(points), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = total_points, n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(season, driver, total_points)
best_drivers_summary
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/champions.png")
```


2.
"The report focuses on the 2nd season, identified as the most representative. New variables 'frequency' (number of races participated) and 'average_points' are added, as detailed in the list below."

```{r season_2_data(example), echo=FALSE}
season_2 <- FERR0 %>%
  filter(season == 2)
season_2_data <- season_2 %>%
  group_by(driver) %>%
  summarise(
    total_points = sum(points),
    average_points = mean(points),
    frequency = n()
    ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_points)) 
season_2_data
```
