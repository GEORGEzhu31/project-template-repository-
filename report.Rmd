## Introduction
Formula E championship, known for its unpredictability due to a myriad of factors such as driver expertise, car performance, circuit characteristics, and race formats, ignites interest in statistical exploration. Emphasizing an unbiased approach, this report aims to explore the relationship between the number of races drivers participated in and their performance.

The report commences with a concise delineation of the methodology for curating pristine data, coupled with an explanation of the selected models. Subsequently, tables, figures, and summary values are presented in a clear and explanatory manner, followed by four linear regression models developed to explore various facets of the data, with each model addressing different conditions such as season exclusions and minimum participation requirements. This study subsequently analyses the model's fitting, advantages, and limitations, and proposes feasible recommendations for future in-depth research. Finally, the report addresses the research objectives and questions, offering responses based on the statistical analysis.


## Methodology
The research process harnesses the capabilities of the tidyverse, tidymodels, and ggplot2 packages, integral tools in the realm of data analysis.

During the initial stage of data cleansing, functions such as select(), slice(), filter(), and summarize () play a pivotal role. These functions meticulously shape and refine the raw data into a structured and coherent format. Moreover, they also help merge information needed such as average points. These data frames, encompassing driver details, total points, average points, and frequency derived from FERR0, lay the groundwork for subsequent analytical endeavors.

Once the requisite data is meticulously gathered, a linear regression analysis is employed to discern potential correlations between various variables. This critical step is executed using ggplot(), with aes(x = Freq, y = avg_points) effectively mapping the relationship. The function geom_point() crafts a point diagram, while geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) elegantly overlays the linear regression line, simultaneously eliminating any surrounding shadows. The visualizations thus produced offer insightful glimpses, potentially guiding preliminary predictive analyses.

Based on the insights obtained from the previous stage, a more detailed investigation of the relationship between average total points and frequency (of attending races) has been carried out. Average total point refers to the average points each driver earns throughout races they attended, which largely reflects the racing level of these drivers. Frequency, on the other hand, indicates the number of competitions the drivers have participated in, which is correlated to the experience of these drivers. 

An initial model (model1) is plotted using linear_reg(), which sets the engine as "lm". Then the command fit() is piped, providing the name of the data and relationship avg_points ~ Freq. Examining the outcomes of this model reveal crucial insights into the estimated intercept and the correlation between these variable pairs.

The original model is visualized by ggplot(). The function geom_point() tells R which type of diagram should be plotted. geom_smooth() provides visualization of the linear regression line as well. To augment the clarity and aesthetic appeal of these diagrams, the labs() layer is incorporated, ensuring the lucid presentation of
information.

Three additional models, named model2, model3, and model4, evolved from the foundational model. They apply specific filters: "season != 7", "Freq >= 3", and a combination of both, supported by derived data frames. These data frames, created using a blend of filter(), group_by(), and summarize(), extract essential information tailored to meet diverse conditions. The efficacy of all four models is appraised using the r squared value obtained from the glance()$r.squared function. The proximity of the r-squared value to 1 is indicative of the strength of the correlation between the x-y variables.

The visualization stage of the derived model is similar to the previous procedure. ggplot() completes the work. Point diagrams are plotted by geom_point().  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) is there to visualize the linear regression line. labs() layer is added as well to improve the presentation of the diagrams.


## Data
1 Graphs

According to The Official Home of Formula E, the champion of the Formula E championship is determined by the driver with the highest cumulative points in the season. The following chart lists the drivers with the highest total points across seven seasons, comparing this data with the champion information provided by Formula E Chronicles(2022).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
best_drivers_summary <- FERR %>%
  group_by(season, driver) %>%
  summarise(total_points = sum(points), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = total_points, n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(season, driver, total_points)
best_drivers_summary
```

2 Example

The table below excerpts data from the most representative Season 2, with new variables such as frequency (number of race participations), total_points (cumulative points), and avg_points (average points) being added.
```{r season_1_data(example), echo=FALSE}
season_1 <- FERR %>%
  filter(season == 1)
season_1_data <- season_1 %>%
  group_by(driver) %>%
  summarise(
    total_points = sum(points),
    average_points = mean(points),
    frequency = n()
    ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_points)) 
season_1_data
```
(Table 2.1)

3 Models

Model 1 is based on the original dataset FERR0 and specifically establishes the positive correlation between the participation frequency and the average scores of all drivers over the past seven seasons. 
```{r model1, echo=FALSE}
#frequency
freq <- 
  select(FERR, driver)  %>% 
  table()
freq_driver1 <- as.data.frame(freq)

#average

avg_driver1 <- FERR %>%
  group_by(driver) %>%
  summarize(avg_points = mean(points, na.rm = TRUE))

freq_avg1 <- full_join(freq_driver1, avg_driver1, by = "driver")
multi_re_fit1 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_points ~ Freq, data = freq_avg1)

multi_re_fit1

model1 <- ggplot(data = freq_avg1, aes(x = Freq, y = avg_points)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "the relationship between average points and frequency in all seasons",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "Average Points") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)
model1 

#r squared of original model
glance(multi_re_fit1)$r.squared
```
(Model 3.1)

Model 2 excludes all data from the 7th season and focuses solely on the relationship between frequency and average points in the first six seasons. The reason for this is that the 7th season had a maximum of only two races, potentially making the data from that season unrepresentative. Formula E Wiki also notes that the 2019/20 season experienced a mid-season hiatus from March to July 2020 due to the pandemic.
```{r model2, echo=FALSE}
#freq filters season != 7 
freq <- filter(FERR, season != "7") %>%
  select(driver)  %>% 
  table()
freq_driver2 <- as.data.frame(freq)

#average filters season != 7
avg_driver2 <- filter(FERR, season != 7 ) %>%
  group_by(driver) %>%
  summarize(avg_points = mean(points, na.rm = TRUE))

#filters season != 7
freq_avg2 <- left_join(freq_driver2, avg_driver2, by = "driver")

#fit model 2
multi_re_fit2 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_points ~ Freq, data = freq_avg2)

#r squared model2, indicating an improvement
glance(multi_re_fit2)$r.squared

multi_re_fit2

#visualize model2
model2 <- ggplot(data = freq_avg2, aes(x = Freq, y = avg_points)) + 
  geom_point() + 
   labs(title = "the relationship between average points and frequency in the first six seasons",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "Average Points") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)
model2

#r squared model2, indicating an improvement
glance(multi_re_fit2)$r.squared
```
(Model 3.2)

Model 3 represents the relationship between average points and frequency among drivers whose frequency is greater than 3. Removing the data of drivers who Participated in less than 2 races in a season is an attempt to minimize the uncertainty.
```{r model3, echo=FALSE}

#freq filters freq >= 3
freq_driver3 <- freq_driver1 %>% filter (Freq >= 3)

#filters freq >= 3
freq_avg3 <- left_join(freq_driver3, avg_driver1, by = "driver")

#fit model 3
multi_re_fit3 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_points ~ Freq, data = freq_avg3)

multi_re_fit3

#visualize model3
model3 <- ggplot(data = freq_avg3, aes(x = Freq, y = avg_points)) + 
  geom_point() + 
   labs(title = "the relationship among drivers whose frequency is greater than 3",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "Average Points") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)
model3

#r squared model3
glance(multi_re_fit3)$r.squared
```
(Model 3.3)

Model 4 is generated by combining the conditions of Model 2 and Model 3 since these two factors may affect the final outcomes of the model.
```{r model4, echo=FALSE}

#freq filters season != 7 and freq >= 3
freq_driver4 <- freq_driver2 %>% 
  filter (Freq >= 3)

#average filters season != 7
avg_driver2 <- filter(FERR, season != 7 ) %>%
  group_by(driver) %>%
  summarize(avg_points = mean(points, na.rm = TRUE))

#filters freq >= 3 and season != 7
freq_avg4 <- left_join(freq_driver4, avg_driver2, by = "driver")

#fit model 4
multi_re_fit4 <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_points ~ Freq, data = freq_avg4)

multi_re_fit4

#visualize model 4
model4 <- ggplot(data = freq_avg4, aes(x = Freq, y = avg_points)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "the relationship among drivers whose frequency is greater than 3 in the first six seasons",
       x = "Frequency",
       y = "Average Points") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE)


model4

#r squared model4, indicating an improvement
glance(multi_re_fit4)$r.squared
```
(Model 3.4)


## Findings
The analysis is augmented by Graph 1.1, which visualizes the highest-scoring drivers per season, juxtaposed with championship data(Graph 1.2) from 2014 to 2021. A key observation here is the consistent championship attainment by the highest accumulated points, suggesting a strong link between scoring and overall success. 

Taking the second season as an example, we delved into the correlation between a driver's participation frequency and their average and total points. The analysis revealed that as a driver's participation frequency increased, there was a noticeable trend towards higher average points, indicating an elevated skill level. This observation led to the formulation of a hypothesis suggesting that an increase in a driver's participation frequency would correspond to a higher average score.

To test this hypothesis, Models 1 through 4 were constructed. Model 1 indeed demonstrated a positive correlation between the two variables, but due to significant data dispersion, it resulted in a relatively low R-squared value of 0.445. Considering the reduction of outliers and the exclusion of data from the 7th season, the results were unexpected as Model 2's R-squared value decreased to 0.434. This indicated that while some outliers were removed, more valid data points were inadvertently excluded. To address this issue, data was optimized by filtering the frequency threshold within a reasonable range (frequency >= 3), resulting in an improved R-squared value of 0.522. Finally, to validate whether both filtering conditions would have a simultaneous effect, Model 4 combined these two filtering criteria and achieved the highest R-squared value of 0.531.

Through multiple iterations and adjustments, the model demonstrated increased concentration, strongly suggesting a significant correlation between a driver's participation frequency and their average performance. This implies a positive relationship between participation frequency and skill level enhancement.

However, the filtering criteria, on one hand, may introduce bias that skews the representation of the data, and on the other hand, may lead to a significant reduction in sample size, potentially failing to capture statistically general phenomena. Furthermore, R-squared values less than 1 still indicate that factors beyond the current scope, such as team dynamics, driver skill progression, and external circumstances, play a significant role in the outcomes.

To enhance the comprehensiveness of our study, future research should incorporate additional variables that could influence a driver's performance. These may include team strategies, technological advancements in vehicles, and even psychological factors affecting drivers during races. An expanded dataset, possibly encompassing more racing seasons, would also provide a broader base for analysis, potentially leading to more conclusive insights.


## Conclusion
In general, this report illustrates that the more races a driver participates in, the higher their level of experience and skill, resulting in higher average and total scores.
